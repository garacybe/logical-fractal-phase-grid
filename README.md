#  logical fractal phase grid

a tiny html thing that turns 4 knobs into swirling neon worms
open the file → fumble with sliders and buttons

an abstract sandbox where a few micro-equations get drunk together, collapse into glowing threads, then arrange themselves into a laser mandala you can fly through or flatten into a tabletop map. 
The whole thing fits in a single html file, so it feels like you smuggled an alien kaleidoscope inside a text message.

## quickest abstract  

take a small bang (*four sliders, two presets, one canvas*) and let the universe spiral into line-loops. the structure is deterministic until it notices you watching, at which point it politely forgets its last frame and begins again.

## optional rituals  

1. **view toggle** – flattens all dimensions into a single slice. consider it the academic’s sudden slideshow.  
2. **axis cycle** – rotates the slice so every direction looks equally culpable.  
3. **wasd** – pilot mode. remember: gravity is a conspiracy, thrust is courtesy of google chrome.  
4. **`** (backtick) – collapses the ui so you can pretend it is pure idea.
