#  logical fractal phase grid

a tiny html thing that turns 4 knobs into swirling neon worms

open the file → fumble with sliders and buttons

an abstract sandbox where a few micro-equations get drunk together, collapse into glowing threads, then arrange themselves into a laser mandala you can fly through or flatten into a tabletop map. 
The whole thing fits in a single html file, so it feels like you smuggled an alien kaleidoscope inside a text message.


## cybernetic hallucination under 25 kb  


take a small bang (*four sliders, two presets, one canvas*) and let the universe spiral into line-loops. the structure is deterministic until it notices you watching, at which point it politely forgets its last frame and begins again.

## alleged functions  

| control | so-called effect |  
|---------|------------------|  
| c1 – curvature hyperventilation | bends the spokes until they whisper |  
| c2 – tonal attitude | adjusts how colors apologize |  
| c3 – time dilation | makes the brain hurt earlier or later |  
| c4 – feedback indulgence | decides whether to listen to itself |

## optional rituals  

1. **view toggle** – flattens all dimensions into a single slice. consider it the academic’s sudden slideshow.  
2. **axis cycle** – rotates the slice so every direction looks equally culpable.  
3. **wasd** – pilot mode. remember: gravity is a conspiracy, thrust is courtesy of google chrome.  
4. **`** (backtick) – collapses the ui so you can pretend it is pure idea.
