an abstract sandbox where a few micro-equations get drunk together, collapse into glowing threads, then arrange themselves into a laser mandala you can fly through or flatten into a tabletop map. 
The whole thing fits in a single html file, so it feels like you smuggled an alien kaleidoscope inside a text message.
